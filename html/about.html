                I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today. Brides
                today are increasingly sensitive to the tastes, feelings and finances of their attendants. It's hard to
                balance everything. It's always challenging. I adore the challenge of creating truly modern clothes,
                where a woman's personality and sense of self are revealed. I want people to see the dress, but focus on
                the woman. It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging.

                All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox. A woman is never sexier than when she is comfortable in her
                clothes. I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today.
                Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last.
